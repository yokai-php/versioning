Purge
-----

Sometime, you may want to remove some versions from the storage.

There is different strategies you may want to implement :
* keep a fixed number of version for each versionable resource
* remove versions of versionable resources that was removed
* etc...

This feature is covered by the [purger](components/purger.md).

> **note** the [Symfony Console component](integration/symfony-console.md) integration has a command to trigger it.
